# Hi, I'm Jayaraj üëã

# About Me

With over 15 years of experience in IT development, operations, and technical leadership, I specialize in driving end-to-end delivery of complex software engineering and AI/ML infrastructure projects.

My career spans a variety of domains including Billing, Revenue Assurance, Fraud Detection, and Interconnect Systems ‚Äî with deep expertise in architecture, requirements analysis, and enterprise integration. I bring a product mindset and hands-on experience in OOAD, full-stack development, and platform engineering.

I have designed and implemented cloud-native solutions on **Azure** and **AWS**, focusing on automation, scalability, and secure cloud infrastructure. I‚Äôm also well-versed in **CI/CD**, **Terraform**, and **CloudFormation** to automate infrastructure provisioning and streamline ML pipeline deployments.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve pivoted into **MLOps and AI platform development**, where I work on:
- Enhancing developer workflows for data and ML engineers
- Integrating with domain experts in **Computer Vision**, **NLP**, and **LLMs**
- Building responsible AI features like **fairness metrics** and **data drift detection**
- Ensuring reliability and observability in ML systems

My strength lies in bridging the gap between engineering and business. I thrive in environments where I can lead cross-functional teams, drive strategic platform decisions, and deliver scalable, secure, and ethical AI systems.

üîç I'm currently exploring opportunities where I can apply my **MLOps, Cloud, and AI platform skills** to solve meaningful challenges and lead high-impact technology teams.
